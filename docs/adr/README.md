# Architecture Decision Records

One numbered Markdown file per decision, in the lightweight
[Michael Nygard](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
format. Numbering is sequential and never reused or renumbered. Template:
[`template.md`](template.md).

Open an ADR when a choice affects the public surface or compatibility, when two reasonable
options exist and the rationale is non-obvious, when a **design pattern** is adopted, or
when superseding a prior decision. Do **not** open one for routine implementation details
or trivially reversible choices.

Status transitions: `Proposed` → `Accepted` → (`Superseded by ADR-XXXX` | `Deprecated`).
