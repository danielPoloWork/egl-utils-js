# Changelog

All notable changes to `egl-utils-js` are documented here, following
[Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/).

Every PR that introduces a user-visible change adds a line to `[Unreleased]` in the same
PR. A release PR moves the `[Unreleased]` entries into a new per-version file under
`docs/changelog/v<MAJOR>/v<X.Y.Z>.md` and adds an index row below.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`focusTrap`, `saveFocus` and `liveRegion` on `egl-utils-js/dom`** — the two things every
  dialog needs, which this library has had exactly once each, inside the F50 overlay where
  nothing could reach them. The trap keeps Tab inside a region and restores focus on release;
  it is **scoped to Tab deliberately**, correcting the edge the key would leave through and
  leaving everything in between to the browser's own tab order, with no document-level
  `focusin` guard to fight focus moved by assistive technology. A root with nothing focusable
  **holds focus itself** rather than losing it to `<body>` — the case that otherwise turns a
  trap into a lock — and what counts as tabbable is decided without reading layout, because a
  forced layout per Tab press is not a price a keyboard user should pay. `saveFocus` is the
  restore half alone, and `loadingOverlay` now calls it instead of keeping its own copy.
  `liveRegion` announces without moving focus, and announcing the same message twice really
  announces it twice — closing a gap ADR-0069 named, where a column moved by the keyboard was
  announced to nobody (spec 07 F109–F110, ROADMAP 20.5,
  [ADR-0070](docs/adr/0070-two-primitives-extracted-and-a-ceiling-recomputed.md)).
